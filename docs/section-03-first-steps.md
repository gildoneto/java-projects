# Section 3 - First Steps

## jshell

`jshell` is a command-line tool that allows you to execute Java code snippets and see the results immediately, without having to write a complete Java program.

## Statement

It's a complete command to be executed. It can include one or more expressions.

```java
System.out.print("Hello World!");
```

What we've typed above, is a command to print some information to the screen, using syntax provided by the Java language.
We specified what we wanted Java to print in the parentheses and double quotes – in this case, the text `"Hello World"` – effectively we're telling Java to print out the words, as we've specified them in the quotes – `"Hello World"`.

## Keywords

A keyword is **any one of a number of reserved words, that have a predefined meaning in the Java language.**
In Java syntax, all code is case-sensitive, and this includes keywords. As we'll soon see, an `int`, all in lowercase, is not the same as `Int`, with a capital **I**. Here, an `int`, (all in lowercase) is a **keyword** in Java.

## Variables

Variables are a way to store information in our computer.
Variables that we define in a program, can be **accessed by a name we give them**, and the computer does the hard work, of figuring out where they get stored, in the computer's **random access memory**, or RAM.

## Data Type

There are lots of different types of data, that we can define for our variables.
Collectively, these are known as data types.
Some data types are keywords in Java. When we get to the **Object-Oriented** features of Java, you will see that we have a lot of flexibility for creating our own data types, but in this section we'll explore primitive data types, which are built into the Java language.

## Declaration Statement

A declaration statement is used to define a variable by indicating the data type, and the name, then optionally to set the variable to a specific value.

## Expressions

An expression is a coding **construct, that evaluates to a single value**.

## Operators

Java operators, or just operators, perform an operation (hence the term) on a variable or value.
Addition, Subtraction, Division, and Multiplication are four common ones that I feel sure you're familiar with, but there are lots more operators.
